## Step 4:
In the script you then look for the line "const MY_NBA_TEAM = "ENTER_TEAM_ABBREVIATION_HERE";" and change it with the appropriate abbreviation for your team. Using the Lakers as an example, the line would then look like this: const MY_NBA_TEAM = "LAL"; 

## Step 5:
You go to your home screen on your iPhone and "click and hold", then select "Edit Home Screen" and click the "+" in the top right corner. Then you search for Scriptable and select it. 

## Step 6:
Now you have the possibility to set the size of the widget. Currently, only the small and medium size are available. For the medium size you have to swipe to the right once and then select "Add widget".
