### The widget doesn't show up properly on the homescreen.
Go to your homescreen, Click&Hold. Edit Homescreen. Right above thereâ€˜s a +. Click it. search Scriptable. Click it. Then you can swipe two times. The first option  is the small widget, when you swipe once you can add the medium one  (this is the one you need) and when swipe two times it's the big one. 

Does it say "Select script in widget configurator"? Then you have to "click & hold" -> "edit widget". Then choose for Script "NBA-MyTeam-Widget", for When Interacting "Run script".

```
with, e.g.

if the Lakers are your team.
